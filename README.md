# JavaScript Homework - JavaScript and DOM Manipulation

## Background

I was recently hired on by `ALIENS-R-REAL,` an online website that publicizes eye-witness reports of extra-terrestrial sightings and menace events, as a data analyst to assist in loading eye-witness reports onto their website platform. For this `ALIENS-R-REAL` assignment, I created a dynamically based table that allows website users to filter the table data for specific extra-terrestrial 'date' sightings and events. 

##### Note: This HTML website was written/edited with JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and D3.js. 

### Level 1: Automatic Table and Date Search (Required)

* Steps taken to create/edit `ALIENS-R-REAL` website: 

  * Used the raw [index.html](StarterCode/index.html) file provided to display website. 

  * Used the JavaScript UFO dataset provided in an array to write a function that appends the table elements to the `ALIENS-R-REAL` web page. 
  
  * Added new rows of extra-terrestrial data for each UFO sighting.

  * Filtered website columns with an HTML DOM Buton Object that can list events and search through the rows that match the user's input:  
  
    `date/time`, `city`, `state`, `country`, `shape`, `comment` .

### Level 2: Multiple Search Categories (Optional)

* Completed all of Level 1 criteria.

* Used multiple `input` tags to write JavaScript code so the user can use multiple filters and search for UFO sightings using the following criteria based on the table columns:

  1. `date/time`
  2. `city`
  3. `state`
  4. `country`
  5. `shape`

### Dataset

* [UFO Sightings Data](UFO-level-1/static/js/data.js)
