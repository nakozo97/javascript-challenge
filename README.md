JavaScript and DOM Manipulation

## Background

I was recently hired on by `ALIENS-R-REAL`, an online website that publicates eye-witness reports of extra-terrestrial sightings and menace events, to assist in loading information onto their website. While at `ALIENS-R-REAL`, I was able to create a dynamically based table that allows `ALIENS-R-REAL`'s users to filter the table data for specific values. This was written with JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and D3.js only. 

### Level 1: Automatic Table and Date Search (Required)

* Used the basic [index.html](StarterCode/index.html) file provided.

* Used the UFO dataset provided in the form of an array of JavaScript objects, to write code that appends a table to our web page and then added new rows of data for each UFO sighting.

  * There is a column for `date/time`, `city`, `state`, `country`, `shape`, and `comment`.

* Used a date form in my HTML document and wrote JavaScript code that will list events and search through the `date/time` column to find rows that match the user's input.
